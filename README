For the vast players of Lunaria Story(TM), it is clear that refinement is a random process.
However, we don't have a clear picture about how easy / hard a refinement process is.

This software can help you estimate how much resources you need to invest to get a successful
result.

== Requirement
* A browser
* Port 8080 should be available
* Java 1.7 or up
* Groovy 2.4 (if you want to build from source)

== Usage

The user interface is designed as web pages, that is, this application is designed as a server.
So after you started the application, run you browser and pointing it to:

http://localhost:8080/

You can see the user interface if everything are ok.
